TODO: Document login-workflows better

This repository is intended to share (Python/R) code with colleagues at the [LMU SODA chair](https://www.stat.lmu.de/soda/en/).

So far it contains two types of materials:

- Helper functions and classes that can be re-used across different projects.
- [Illustrative code examples](https://github.com/malsch/lmu-soda-utils/Basic_Samples) to get started with Azure Open AI.
