# LMU SODA Utilities

Welcome!

This repository from the [LMU SODA chair](https://www.stat.lmu.de/soda/en/) is intended to share knowledge and code (Python/R/...?) with colleagues and students. It contains three types of materials:

### 1 Tutorials

We share some [introductionary tutorials](./azure-quick-start/) that should help you to get started with some technologies we like to use. All the tutorials available so far are related to our Azure subscription.

> [!TIP] 
> The [introductionary tutorials](./azure-quick-start/) provide a great entry point to and overview of the content of this repository.

### 2 Code Recipies

The folder [code-recipies](./code-recipies/) contains simple recipies (Python/R/...?) you can try out.


### 3 Technological Literacy

You want to work more efficient with your computer? The folder [technological-literacy](./technological-literacy) contains very brief and seemingly random notes about diverse technical topics. This is less related to our work and not the focus of the repository. We will link to these notes from other files within the repository.

## Help us improve

Is something in this repository unclear or not working for you? Do you have ideas about additional material we should cover in this repository?

Knowledge sharing is a common good and in everyone's responsibility!
