# LMU SODA Utilities

Welcome!

This repository is intended to share knowledge and code (Python/R/...?) with colleagues and students at the [LMU SODA chair](https://www.stat.lmu.de/soda/en/). It contains three types of materials:

### 1 Tutorials

We share some [introductionary tutorials](./azure-quick-start/) that should help you getting started with some technologies we like to use. All tutorials available so far are related to our Azure subscription.

> [!TIP] A great entry point to the content in this repository is our [Azure OpenAI tutorial](./azure-quick-start/azure-open-ai-tutorial.md).

### 2 Code Recipies

The folder [code-recipies](./code-recipies/) contains simple recipies (Python/R/...?) you can try on you own. 


### 3 Technological Literacy

The folder [technological-literacy](./technological-literacy) contains very brief and seemingly random introductions to diverse technical topics one should know about to work more efficiently with ones computer. This is not the focus of the repository. We will link to these introductions from other files within the repository.
